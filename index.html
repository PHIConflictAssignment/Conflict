  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-4 columns">
      <h5>Substantive Conflict</h5>
        <p>Substantive conflict, which revolves around the task at hand, where members conceptualize, analyze, and evaluate ideas and information. This type of conflict can be beneficial to team growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="large-4 columns">
      <h5>Affective Conflict</h5>
        <p>Affective conflict stems from interpersonal power clashes. They can be work related or personal opinions and views. This type of conflict can detour a team from its timeline and goals.</p>

    <div class="large-4 columns"> 
      <h5>Procedural Conflict</h5>
        <p>Procedural conflict arises from the “how” the group should do things, including how the group will make future decisions and meeting times.</p>

                <p>DeVian Inc. is an up and coming Web Development team. The team consists of members, Adam - Web Master, Jenny – Front End Design and Jake - System Administrator & Content. Each member relies on each other to meet deadlines. Adam, who constructs the backend development, relies on Jenny’s design comps to start his coding. In Adam’s opinion, Jenny should submit design comps within 24 hours of the team’ s agreed direction. Jenny has other functions within the group that she feels impedes her ability to achieve this goal.</p>
                <h5>As Jake, which would you do?</h5>

Since the team members have known one another for many years outside of work, Jenny feel comfortable with being late to assigned meetings from time to time. Lately, Jenny’s tardiness has made it difficult for the other members and their projects’ timelines. When the other members bring up the issue, Jenny becomes offended and starts to withdraw from the group.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, conflict occurs everywhere you go in everything you do. It is impossible to avoid and can be best utilized when effective proactive steps are taken. We all know how challenging it can be to step up and make waves. Thus, it is imperative in a group situation that everyone finds a happy medium, which allows for a flexible give and take relationship, where each members ideas and views can be analyzed and evaluated to come up with the best option for the team.</p>

          <p>Conflict avoidance can be described as the refusal to speak up when confronted with an issue that an individual does not agree with. Although in some cases this might be the best option, potential for group growth may be lost if members are not comfortable to express ideas and concerns. There are many factors that contribute to avoidance. Some examples are; lack of self-esteem, avoidance of any conflict, unresponsive management, and even cultural or personal views. When working in a group remember to first evaluate if the situation needs your call to action. Wait for your turn to talk and clearly and calmly describe the idea or concern. Remember to always keep your cool and take a break from the topic if needed. Always remember that you, are uniquely you, and be confident to put your self out there!<br/><br/>  

          An example of conflict avoidance would be an individual that has an idea. They want to share it with the group, but are afraid to because of a previous poor experience they had. So they remain silent.

          <p>The Accommodation style of conflict resolution is very common in the workplace, marriages, and domestic partnerships alike. It occurs when one person or party decides it is better to concede to the other party rather than argue their point. In most cases, this style of conflict resolution is highly effective. However, there can be times when using this style of conflict resolution will result in resentment and hard feelings on the side that makes the accommodation. If you are receiving the accommodations, it is always a good idea, good practice and just common courtesy, to acknowledge the accommodations that are being made by the other party. A simple thank you goes a long way when working with others.<br/><br/>

          Here is an example of the accommodation style of conflict resolution being used in a marriage. Mary wants to go to her parent’s house for Thanksgiving. Barry, her husband would rather sit at home and watch the game. For the sake of not wanting to argue, Barry concedes to his wife’s wishes and spends Thanksgiving at Mary’s parents house.

          <p>In conflict management, competition lies opposite to accommodation. While both are considered win-lose styles, where one side wins and the other loses, competition takes the more aggressive approach and is usually based in “suspicious and hostile attitudes” and “a willingness to exploit the other's needs if possible” (Rudawsky, 1999).<br/><br/>

          You’ll often find competition used as a fall back strategy for group members with highly assertive personalities. Although competitive tactics often cause conflict to increase, if used appropriately, for example, in a conflict where an emergency or crisis exists, it can be a powerful and effective style. <br/><br/>

          Before utilizing a competitive approach, take time to consider whether or not it’s appropriate for the situation, allow opposing ideas to be thoroughly explained first, and make a sincere effort to help the other party see how your position could benefit them, and what they could gain from agreement with your proposal.</p>

          <p>The Compromise resolution style of conflict can be called a partial-win/partial-lose solution. Compromise happens when each party gives up something to get something in return. With compromise, both parties are satisfied when they each have something to take away from the exchange. In this style both parties lose a little, however, they each win in the end. Compromise is all about fairness. A compromise will work when both parties feel the solution is fair and they both benefit from the solution.<br/><br/>

          Here is an easy example of compromise. Two people are having dinner and both want the last piece of bread. Instead of fighting over it, they split it in half and share it.
